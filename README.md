# Astrolog-64
64-bit Astrolog. If you don't need a 64-bit version of Astrolog, you should probably just stick with Walter Pullen's official release at his site. You can find more information about Astrolog there or at the forum (https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/Astrolog_List/info) and Facebook (https://www.facebook.com/astrologprogram) pages.

Also, I have recently posted Linux and Mac (terminal only) versions. As far as I know, the Mac version works, but since I do not own a Mac I have no way to test it properly.

That being said, if someone wants to support Macs (I just cross my fingers and hope it compiles.), feel free to fork this repository and submit your own Mac specific pull requests. As long as they don't break the Windows & Linux builds, I'll be more than happy to accept them. :)
