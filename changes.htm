<p class=FA>                         **  VERSION 6.50  **</p>

<p class=FA>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=A>Release notes for Astrolog version 6.50 (July 2019):</p>

<p class=A>Happy start of Leo everyone! :) This file describes the freeware
astrology software program Astrolog version 6.50 and the additions and fixes
made to it, over the previous version 6.40 which was released exactly one year
ago in July 2018. The main things in this update are 3D astrocartography charts
(instead of just 2D rectangular charts), more support for stars, and a number
of bug fixes.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=feature>NEW FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are new additions to version 6.50 that weren't in previous
versions:</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>1. 3D astro-graph charts:</span> Astrolog supports 3D graphic
astrocartography charts, which are drawn on a spherical globe instead of just a
flat rectangular map. This globe can be rotated and animated, and in the Windows
version you can right click and drag to view different parts of the world. To display
a 3D astro-graph chart, select the “Graphics / Show Globe” command (-XG switch
on the command line). The 3D astro-graph is a separate chart from Astrolog’s
existing classic astro-graph chart (accessed with -L -X switches). You can even
toggle between them with the “3D Houses” command (-c3 switch or “a” hotkey).</p>

<p class=B>As with the classic 2D astro-graph chart, by default Midheaven lines
are yellow, Ascendant lines are red, Descendant lines are green, and Nadir
lines are blue. The Midheaven lines will be labeled at the planet’s zenith
point, Nadir lines at the planet’s nadir point, and Ascendant and Descendant
lines at Earth’s equator. Midheaven and Ascendant lines have glyphs in the
planet’s color, while Descendant and Nadir lines always have glyphs in gray. The
presence of Midheaven, Ascendant, Descendant, and Nadir lines can each be individually
toggled with the “Rising and Setting Restrictions” in Display Settings (-YRZ switch).
If all four are restricted, then planets will still be plotted but only at
their zenith points, which duplicates behavior from previous versions. A
magenta dot will be drawn at the location for the chart, with a dotted line
around that latitude in order to make latitude crossings near the location more
apparent. This dot can be turned off by toggling the “Text Astro-Graph Shows Latitude
Crossings” flag in Chart Settings (-L0 switch).</p>

<p class=B>Internally, the 3D astro-graph chart is part of Astrolog’s globe display,
which even in previous versions would plot the zenith location of each planet
on the map. This feature just extends it by also drawing each planet’s four
sets of lines upon the globe. That means astro-graph lines are supported on
Astrolog’s other world map displays, namely the rectangular world map
(including the oval shaped Mollewide projection of it), and polar projection
world map. The rectangular world map (-XW switch) is very similar to Astrolog’s
existing graphic astro-graph chart (-L -X switches), except for differences in
how the lines are labeled. (Users may prefer one style to the other.) You can
switch between the two styles of rectangular astro-graph chart with the “L”
(for classic astro-graph chart) and “W” (for world map showing astro-graph
lines) hotkeys.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>2. Sunshine houses:</span> Astrolog now supports the
Sunshine system of house division. Similar to APC houses, in Sunshine houses
non-angular cusps aren’t always 180 degrees opposite each other. Near the
poles, Sunshine houses can have five cusps in a row overlapping, and therefore
have four houses in row zero sized. In the Windows version this system can be
selected with a new menu command on the “House System” submenu. On the command
line, Sunshine houses can be accessed with “-c 20”.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>3. Mixed progressions:</span> Astrolog supports a
mixed progression mode in which the planets are secondary progressed (meaning
planetary positions are computed at a future date) but house cusps are
progressed by solar arc (meaning the same offset is applied to all cusps). In
the Progressions dialog, select the new “Secondary (Solar Arc Cusps)” option to
compute in this manner. From the command line, use the new -p1 switch to do
progressions of this type. (Note that “p1” can be used in all switch contexts
that “p” for secondary progressions can, and “p0” for solar arc progressions can.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>4. Cusp progression factor:</span> The rate that
progressed house cusps move (whether computed or by solar arc) compared to the
default can be specified. In the Progressions dialog, change the new “Cusp Move
Ratio” field to define the slowness factor to apply to progressed house cusps.
From the command line, use the new -pC &lt;number&gt; switch to set this value.
For example, Astrolog’s default for secondary progressions is quotidian, which
means the cusps move 360 degrees around the zodiac each day. However, other
types of progression have the cusps move the same speed as the Sun. Change the
cusp move ratio field from “1” to “365.24219” (values are in the dropdown) and
that will make cusps move 365.24219 times slower, which will make them move
just 1 degree per day, about the same as the Sun.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>5. Ecliptic axis:</span> Astrolog’s chart sphere and
local horizon charts use the local horizon for its “equator”, while Astrolog’s
globe charts are aligned with the Earth’s equator. These charts can be tilted
so they’re aligned with the ecliptic instead, with the new “Use Ecliptic Axis”
command on the “Graphics / Map Effects” submenu (or use the new -YXe switch on
the command line). When in this mode, rotating and tilting the globe will do so
relative to the ecliptic.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>6. Star distance ordering:</span> Lists of fixed star
objects (such as in text charts and in the wheel chart sidebar) can be ordered
by distance from the viewer. Select the new “By Distance” option in the “Fixed
Star Ordering” section of the Chart Settings dialog (or use the new -Ud switch
on the command line). Note that determining star distances requires Swiss
Ephemeris to be the calculation method. Older calculation methods will assume
all stars are exactly 100 light years away from our Sun.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>7. New aspect sorting methods:</span> Aspect sorting
in the aspect list chart, and in the transit influence charts (-a, -D, and -T
switches) can be sorted by two new methods. The -a switch can be invoked as -aP
to sort by the name of the second object forming the aspect (similar to how -aO
sorts by the name of the first object forming the aspect). The -a switch can
also be invoked as -aD to sort by the zodiac position of the second object
(similar to how -aC sorts by the position of the first object).</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>8. Search paths:</span> The new -Yi &lt;path&gt; switch
is a way to specify search paths for loading files, such as ephemeris files and
chart information files. This switch takes one parameter indicating a directory
to look within for files. There are actually ten different switches -Yi0
through -Yi9 (in which -Yi by itself is equivalent to -Yi0) which can cover ten
different paths. The default astrolog.as default settings file contains a
couple instances of -Yi pointing to sample directories. Note that -Yi can’t be
used to help find astrolog.as itself for its initial loading, because the
astrolog.as file is loaded early before even the command line is processed. However,
because the directory of the executable is searched before anything else,
placing astrolog.as next to the executable will ensure it’s found, and -Yi
switches inside astrolog.as can be used to point to any other paths. System
environment variables pointing to directories such as ASTROLOG are still
supported, but are no longer necessary to define file paths.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>9. Central planet autorestriction:</span> Changing the
central planet will now automatically unrestrict the old central planet and restrict
the new central planet from appearing in charts. For example, switching from
geocentric to heliocentric (through either the Windows interface or the command
line) will automatically restrict the Sun and unrestrict the Earth to reflect
what looks best in a heliocentric chart. Restrictions will only be changed if
both the old central planet is restricted and the new central planet is unrestricted.
This behavior is active by default, but can be prevented with the new -YRh
switch. If turned on, then no restrictions will change when the central planet
is changed.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>10. Aspect line dashedness:</span> In graphics charts,
dashed lines are used when drawing aspect lines whose orbs aren’t exact, with
more space between points indicating a wider orb. The -YXa &lt;num&gt; switch
indicates the maximum number of pixels allowed to be skipped between set
pixels. Limits are useful to prevent very wide orbs from being hard to see.
Images such as <a href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/pic/orbit2.png">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/pic/orbit2.png</a>
(which compares Earth’s to Venus’ orbit over time) are generated by having 360
degree orbs, or always drawing a line between two planets (and never with any
dashedness in them, so -YXa 0 is used).</p>

<p class=B>If the parameter is negative, then that modifies aspect lines so
that exact aspects are drawn solid, and aspects at the orb limit for the aspect
in question are drawn with &lt;num&gt; spaces between points. This may be
preferred to the default behavior in which the dashedness of the line is only
based on the number of degrees the aspect is different from exact. The default
behavior will result in aspects to the North Node (which by default only allows
a two degree orb to it) to always be nearly solid, even if the aspect is near
the orb limit for being shown at all. The Modify Display command (-Xi switch)
will toggle between these two display modes (i.e. it negates the value of the
-YXa switch).</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>11. Solar system sidereal:</span> The new “Solar
System Sidereal” flag in the Calculation Settings dialog (-Ys switch) will
modify sidereal zodiac positions to be relative to the plane of the solar
system (instead of relative to the plane of the ecliptic, which is the
default). The difference is subtle, especially for centuries near the present,
however the solar system plane is stable relative to the background of stars,
in comparison to the ecliptic which does change over time. As a result this
option is useful for stellar animations spanning many thousands of years. For
example, the animation <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/dipper2.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/dipper2.gif</a>
covering a million years was generated with this setting on.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>12. Color palette updating:</span> The new -YXK switch
can be used to redefine the actual colors within Astrolog’s default color
palette. It takes two parameters, the name of the color to redefine, and the
new RGB color value to use for that color index. The RGB color value can either
be a three comma separated decimal numbers, or the “#” character followed by three
two character hexadecimal numbers in sequence. For example, “-YXK Orange 255,127,0”
or “-YXK Orange #ff7f00” will change the color “Orange” from the dark yellow
that’s the default to an actual fiery orange color.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>13. Extra star labeling:</span> The -XU switch to
display the list of additional stars can have the stars displayed as larger
dots, and can also have the stars labeled with their names. Stars will be
labeled with their traditional or common name (if any), otherwise by their
scientific nomenclature abbreviation. The -XU switch can be invoked as -XU1 to
turn on larger dot placement, -XU2 to turn on name labeling, -XU3 to do both,
and -XU0 to do neither.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>14. Extra star colors:</span> The new -YkU switch can
be used to specify colors to use for particular extra stars when the Show All
Stars setting (-XU switch) is active. It takes one parameter, which is a comma
separated list of string pairs. These pairs indicate the name of a star
followed by the name of the color to use for it. For example, “-YkU
Alkaid,Red,Mizar,Blue,Alioth,Green,Megrez,Yellow,Dubhe,Orange,Merak,Magenta,Phecda,Purple”
will highlight the seven stars of the Big Dipper in the seven Ray colors.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>15. Extra star restrictions:</span> The collection of
extra stars shown by the Show All Stars setting (-XU switch) supports ways of
focusing upon or excluding certain stars. The new -YRU switch will restrict
certain stars from appearing, while the -YRU0 switch will make only certain
stars appear and ignore all the rest. It takes one parameter, which is a comma
separated list of strings indicating star names. For example, “-YRU0
Alkaid,Mizar,Alioth,Megrez,Phecda,Merak,Dubhe” will make the extra stars
feature only show the seven stars of the Big Dipper, and skip all other stars.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>16. Extra star lines:</span> When the extra stars
shown by the Show All Stars setting (-XU switch) are drawn, lines can be drawn
between certain pairs of stars. The new -YXU switch will define what stars to
draw lines between. It takes two parameters, a comma separated list of strings
indicating stars that may have lines connected to them, and a comma separated
list of number pairs indicating indexes of stars within the list of strings to
connect. For example, “-YXU Alkaid,Mizar,Alioth,Megrez,Phecda,Merak,Dubhe
0,1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6” will draw lines among the seven stars of the Big
Dipper.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>17. Monthly rising and setting:</span> The -Zd switch
which prints rising and setting times has been extended to support scanning an
entire month, year, or range of years. The -Zdm switch will scan the entire
month, the -Zdy switch will scan the whole year, and the -ZdY &lt;years&gt;
switch will scan the number of years specified starting with the current year.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>18. Windows hourglass:</span> The new -Wh switch
toggles whether the Windows version shows an hourglass mouse pointer while
calculating and drawing charts. This setting is on by default, but one may want
to turn it off during animations to prevent the mouse pointer from continually
flashing to and from the hourglass.</p>

<p class=A><span class=V>19. Disable warnings:</span> The new -Wt switch
disables warning popup messages in the Windows version, such as ephemeris files
not being found. One scenario where this can be used is star charts for the
distant past or future. Heliocentric barycentric positions of fixed stars don’t
require calculating the position of the Sun, and therefore can be calculated
for any date and don’t depend on ephemeris files being available. However,
Astrolog will still warn about dates out of range, which can be ignored in this
scenario. For example, the animation <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/dipper2.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/dipper2.gif</a>
covering a million years was generated with -Wt on.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=extend>EXTENDED AND IMPROVED FEATURES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A list of improvements to existing features in Astrolog 6.50, such
as new things you can now do with old features that you couldn’t do before, or
ways existing features work better than before:</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>1. 3D star positions:</span> Astrolog’s graphic Solar
System Orbit chart (-S -X switches) will now display star objects, as well as
the list of additional stars. If stars objects are unrestricted, or the list of
additional stars is being shown, then their positions will be plotted in this
chart. Because stars are so far away, the chart scaling will be in light years
instead of Astronomical Units (AU), which is a factor of about 63000. That will
make all planets appear to be overlapping in the middle of the chart, and as a
result when showing stars it’s recommended to restrict all non-star objects
except the Sun. Astrolog’s 3D wireframe file of this chart will plot stars in
3D space, resulting in a 3D environment in which one can explore the local area
of the galaxy. For example, the Astrolog animation <a
href="http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/dipper.gif">http://www.astrolog.org/astrolog/screen/dipper.gif</a>
flies through space around the Big Dipper, allowing one to see how it appears
from different angles.</p>

<p class=B>Astrolog’s text mode Solar System Orbit chart will also now display
star objects. For stars, the “Length” column will measure light years (instead
of Astronomical Units, as is done for planets). Note 1 light year is about
63000 AU, so the stars are actually more distant by this factor.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>2. Star centered charts:</span> The central planet
setting (-h switch) allows doing heliocentric or other planet centered charts.
This has been extended to support star objects. This means you can cast a chart
centered on another star, and see how the stars and constellations appear from
the position of that star. Stars are very far apart from each other, and the
closest star to our Sun is 4.4 light years away, or nearly 10,000 times farther
away than Neptune. As a result, from other star systems all the planets will
appear very close to the Sun (within one arc minute or even narrower depending
on the star). Note that the object “Andromeda” or M31 is actually a galaxy, which
means casting a chart centered on it will actually do a chart from the
perspective of another galaxy! Because the Andromeda galaxy is 2.5 million
light years away, from its point of view all the other stars will appear very
close together (within 3.5 arc minutes).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>3. All stars in object list:</span> The object list
table (-HO switch) will include the list of additional stars if the Show All Stars
setting (-XU switch) is on. The extra stars will be in a separate list after
the main list of objects. For each star it will show the scientific
nomenclature abbreviation (in which something like “alCyg” means Alpha Cygni),
the current zodiac position and ecliptic latitude of the star, it’s magnitude
or brightness, and finally its traditional or common name (if any). Rows will
be colored dark gray (for dim stars magnitude 4.0 or above), light gray, or
white (for bright stars below magnitude 2.0).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>4. Stars in planet info:</span> The list planet
information table (-HS switch) will include star objects if they’re
unrestricted. For stars, the “Distance” column will measure light years (instead
of Astronomical Units as is done for planets) which is a factor of about 63000.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>5. Logarithmic moon orbit:</span> In the graphic Solar
System Orbit chart (-S -X switches), having the 3D Houses setting on causes
planet distances from the central object to be rendered on a logarithmic scale,
to make orbits roughly equally spaced and prevent inner planets from being
squished together. This option now also affects the Moon’s orbit around the
Earth, and makes lunar objects appear a visible distance from the Earth. The
video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSZzytVUzgI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jSZzytVUzgI</a>
shows this in action, in which the Moon can be seen orbiting the Earth, while
Earth and the other planets can be seen orbiting the Sun.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>6. Chart sphere directions:</span> The graphic chart
sphere is now affected by the “Rising and Setting Restrictions” in Display
Settings (-YRZ switch). The four lines from the center of the sphere to the
North/South/West/East points on the horizon will only be displayed if the
corresponding Nadir/Zenith/Setting/Rising flag is unrestricted. If all four are
restricted, then the prime vertical line across the sphere will go away too. If
all four are restricted and the show house details setting is off as well, then
the horizon and meridian lines will go away too, leaving just the lines of the
ecliptic marking the signs of the zodiac. (This last scenario goes well with
turning on the new Use Ecliptic Axis setting, to align the sphere with the
ecliptic.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>7. More aspect sorting:</span> The nine different
options for methods of sorting aspects (specified as subswitches to -a) apply
to additional charts. They now apply to the relationship comparison version of
the aspect list (-a -r0 switches), and the transit influence charts (-D and -T
switches).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>8. Aspect details:</span> Aspects listed in various
charts display the sign of the objects making the aspects. If the “Print
Nearest Second” setting is on (-b0 switch) these positions will now be printed
to the nearest arc-minute. This affects the aspect list, midpoint list, transit
to transit times and influence charts, and transit to natal times and influence
charts (-a, -m, -d, -D, -t, and -T switches).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>9. House cusp transits:</span> The “Transit To Transit
Times” chart (-d switch) will now include house cusp objects if the “Graphs
Include All Planets” setting is on (-B0/V0 switches). Normally cusp objects
like the Ascendant are always excluded from this chart (even if unrestricted)
to avoid too many aspects being displayed. This is now an option if you want to
see when planets conjunct house cusps, which also means when during the day
they move between houses.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>10. Transit graph scrolling:</span> In the Windows
version, the vertical scrollbar can be used to scroll down the list of aspects
in the graphical transit charts (-B/-V -X switches). Before if there were too
many aspects for the window height, there was no way to see the rest other than
resizing the window taller or restricting content.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>11. Yearly ephemeris interface:</span> In the Windows
version, there’s a new “Ephemeris Is For Entire Year” checkbox in the Chart
Settings dialog, which allows toggling between the monthly and yearly ephemeris
tables. This option was already available through the “Modify Chart” command or
the command line, but it’s more easily discovered here. </p>

<p class=A><span class=W>12. Text background colors:</span> In the Windows
version, text mode charts (with the “Show Graphics” command setting off) may
have backgrounds of any color. The background is by default back or white (as
determined by the “Reverse Background” command setting) and can be changed by
redefining these colors in the standard color palette.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>13. Cusp latitudes:</span> House cusp objects will now
have their latitudes listed in the standard listing (-v switch). Before,
latitudes would always be blank for cusps. House cusp objects are on the
ecliptic and so usually have latitude 0, however settings like “Equatorial Positions”
in Calculation Settings (-sr switch) can change them.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>14. Sidebar cusps:</span> The graphic wheel chart
sidebar can now include house cusp objects in the list of planets. Each cusp
object will only be included if it’s different from the actual house cusp.
Normally cusp objects are redundant, since the positions of the 12 houses are
already listed, however (for example) some house systems have the Ascendant
different from the 1st house, or the Midheaven different from the 10th, which
means it’s important to list them.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>15. Non-star skipping:</span> The list of additional
stars (-XU switch) will only include physical stars and skip “virtual” bodies
such as the galactic pole, if the “Graphs Include All Planets” setting in the
Transits dialog is off (-B0/V0 switches). This will reduce the number of stars
in the additional stars list from 1111 to 1100. Non-star points like this are
apparent in the sefstars.txt star list file because they have non-standard
magnitudes like 0.0 or 999.99.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>16. Astro-graph line improvement:</span> The graphic
astro-graph chart (-L -X switches) uses red for Ascendant lines and green for
Descendant lines, and when two of these lines meet, a horizontal gray line would
connect them. This no longer happens, and the connecting line is half red and
half green in the appropriate proportion. Note that Ascendant and Descendant
lines touch at the high or low latitude marks, and those points are intersected
by the planet’s Midheaven or Nadir lines.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>17. Smoother glyphs:</span> Astrolog has a new set of
sign and house glyphs used when the character scale is 300% or “Large”. They
will make charts at this scale look smoother, instead of just drawing the small
100% scale glyphs at triple scale, which looked blocky.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>18. Improved labeling:</span> The type of chart will
be more accurately labeled in the text mode wheel chart (-w switch), and in the
graphic sidebar. Topocentric charts will be labeled as such (instead of just as
geocentric), and barycentric charts will be labeled as such (instead of just as
heliocentric).</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>19. More sidebar labeling:</span> The graphic sidebar
will include additional lines to indicate less common chart types, which makes
it easier to see when a particular mode is in effect. Included will be whether
the chart is progressed (and if so what date it’s progressed to), along with
special indicators if the decan, dwad, domal, or geodetic houses settings are
on. Solar charts will be indicated too, and will mention how the planet positions
are being rotated. It will indicate what planet is being rotated to what
position, and whether the rotating is to the start of sign, e.g. “Sun on
Ascendant” or “Moon’s sign on Midheaven”.</p>

<p class=A><span class=W>20. Horizon charts separate:</span> On the command
line, the text mode local horizon chart (-Z switch) is now considered a
distinct chart from the rising and setting times table (-Zd switch). That means
they can both be displayed at once if both switches are included, and also the
-e switch to display all charts will now include both.</p>

<p class=Section><a name=change>PROGRAM CHANGES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>A few changes that aren't new feature additions or bug fixes have
been made to Astrolog 6.50, which means certain old assumptions are no longer
valid. Most can be considered improvements, but they still change existing
behavior. A list of these follows (which aren't useful to be aware of unless
you have used previous versions of the program):</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>1. Map defaults:</span> In the Windows version, the
world map and globe charts start out showing planets at their zenith locations.
(And beyond that will show meridian lines and the entire astro-graph chart by
default, as described in the new 3D astro-graph feature.) You have to enter the
Modify Display mode (-Xi switch or “i” hotkey) to switch to showing only the
world map. Before, the map displays would start out only showing the map, which
means the effect of the Modify Display mode has been reversed for how it
affects maps.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>2. Time / Space midpoint interface:</span> In the
Windows version, the “Time / Space Midpoint” relationship chart command will
now stay in this mode, after replacing chart #1 with the midpoint of chart #1
and chart #2. The original contents of chart #1 will be stored in the
“previous” chart slot, and will be restored upon exiting the mode. After
exiting this mode, the “previous” chart slot will contain the information for
the midpoint chart. Before, this command would replace chart #1 with the
midpoint, and then immediately exit the relationship chart mode, which would
clobber the data for chart #1 and make it harder to switch back and forth
between modes.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>3. Wheel aspects interface:</span> In graphic wheel
charts, showing aspect lines in the middle of the wheel is no longer toggled
with the Modify Display command (-Xi switch or “i” hotkey). It’s now toggled
with the Show Equator setting (-Xe switch or “e” hotkey). The Modify Display
command now toggles the dashedness of the aspect lines in the middle of the
wheel (i.e. it negates the value of the new -YXa switch).</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>4. Location setting changed:</span> Right clicking on
astro-graph charts and world maps will no longer set the chart location to the
point clicked upon. Right clicking and dragging will now rotate or slide the
world map chart in the same way you can right click and drag to rotate globes
and chart spheres. One can still relocate on astro-graph and world map charts
by Alt+left clicking on them.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>5. Environment variable renamed:</span> The version
specific environment variable for file paths in Astrolog 6.50 is “ASTR650”.
Previous versions has a period present, e.g. the previous version’s environment
variable was “ASTR6.40”. This change is because some environments such as Unix
don’t allow periods in environment variables.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>6. Star renamed:</span> The fixed star object “Rigel
Kent.” has been renamed to “Rigil Kent.” because the latter spelling is more
common. It also makes this star (Rigil Kentaurus, also known as Alpha Centauri)
more easily distinguished from “Rigel” (the brightest star in Orion).</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>7. Documentation renamed:</span> In the Windows
version, the “Open Helpfile” command is now “Open Documentation”. Also, this
command now appears at the top of the Help menu, in addition to on the “More Documentation”
submenu.</p>

<p class=A><span class=X>8. Constellation grid setting:</span> The rectangular
constellation map (-XF switch) would show a grid of dots for scale sizes 300%
and above. These dots become clutter if also displaying the list of additional
stars. This grid will now only be shown if the 3D Houses setting is also on.</p>

<p class=A>&nbsp;</p>

<div style='border:none;border-top:solid windowtext 4.5pt;padding:1.0pt 0in 0in 0in'>

<p class=Section><a name=bug>BUG FIXES</a></p>

</div>

<p class=A>Here are bugs or other issues with version 6.40, all of which have
been corrected in this release:</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>1. Time zone inaccuracy:</span> Half hour time zone abbreviations
mapped to incorrect offsets. For example, selecting “HST” in the time zone
dropdown (or passing “HST” to the -z switch) would be treated as a time zone 18
minutes instead of 30 minutes after the hour.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>2. Daylight time corruption:</span> Saving chart
information when the Daylight time field is anything other than “Yes” or “No” (which
includes “Autodetect” in the Windows version) would save a bad value to file. A
copy of the time zone would be saved instead of the Daylight field, which would
distort the chart by that amount if reloaded.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>3. Chart position latitude saving:</span> Chart
position files wouldn’t correctly save objects whose ecliptic latitude was
between 0 and -1 degrees. Reloading would drop the negative and place the
planet between 0 and 1 degrees.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>4. Transit graph years:</span> The -Vy and -VY
switches to do a transit to natal graph for a year or five year period would
only do a graph for a single month. This only affected the command line, and
not when selecting a year or years in the Windows version.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>5. Star sidereal bug:</span> Fixed stars would be positioned
incorrectly when the sidereal zodiac was on, because the tropical to sidereal
offset would be applied twice. This affected the 47 main fixed star objects,
and not the extra list of 1100 stars which were computed correctly.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>6. Star velocity inaccuracy:</span> Star velocities were
only implemented in a primitive fashion, in that sidereal zodiac stars were
always velocity 0, and tropical zodiac star velocities were always the slow average
precession rate, and also the velocities relative to average speed setting (-v0
switch) wouldn’t have any effect. Star velocities are accurate now, and will be
different for different stars based on their individual (very slow) proper
motions. They will also vary for geocentric charts, because Earth’s orbit
around the Sun produces a minor parallax effect which can cause stars to appear
retrograde at times. Star velocities will also be affected by the average speed
setting (-v0 switch) at least for the tropical zodiac. (In the sidereal zodiac
the average speed of a star is 0 since there’s no precession, and as a result
average speed can’t be computed since you can’t divide by zero.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>7. Extra stars adjustment omission:</span> The
positions of the additional list of stars (-XU switch) wouldn’t take into account
various settings. The additional stars are now affected by the settings for
harmonic charts (-x switch), decans (-3 switch), dwads (-4 switch), and
navamsas (-9 switch).</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>8. Extra stars bitmap omission:</span> In the Windows
version, saving the graphics chart to Windows bitmap format or copying a bitmap
to the clipboard wouldn’t include the list of additional stars in the bitmap
file.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>9. Extra stars monochrome omission:</span> Monochrome mode
(-Xm switch) wouldn’t affect the display of additional stars in the Windows
version, and such stars would still be displayed in multiple shades of gray.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>10. Latitude ephemeris display inaccuracy:</span> The
graphic ephemeris when graphing planetary latitudes (-E -X -ap switches) would
only extend out half as wide as it should.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>11. Chart bi-sphere aspects bug:</span> Chart spheres
in bi-wheel mode and beyond would show improper aspect lines within charts other
than the first chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>12. Chart sphere glitch:</span> Chart spheres display
lines across the meridian with hatch marks at every degree. These hatch marks
weren’t displayed at the 30 and 60 degree marks.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>13. Bi-wheel sidebar display:</span> Charts with no
time or space wouldn’t display right in the bi-wheel chart sidebar. If chart #1
had no time or space, then all charts in the sidebar would be displayed as
such. If only charts #2 or beyond had no time or space, then they would not be
displayed as such, and would display bad data for their chart date (including
corrupt data for the month).</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>14. Bi-wheel 3D houses bug:</span> 3D houses wouldn’t
display right in bi-wheels and beyond. Turning 3D houses on would adjust based
on the wrong wheel, making planets jump wildly.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>15. Transit relationship list:</span> The text mode transit
to natal and progressed to natal comparison charts (-rt and -rp switches) would
display four charts (wrongly including the data for charts #3 and #4) instead
of just two charts.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>16. Text composite comparison:</span> In the text mode
comparison chart (-v -r0 switches), charts with no time or space (such as
composite) wouldn’t be labeled as such, and would instead be shown with a bogus
month.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>17. Bi-wheel composite bug:</span> Charts with no time
or space (such as composite) wouldn’t work well in bi-wheels or beyond. The
chart data would often snap to some chart with an actual time, or have the
positions overwritten in some other fashion.                                                                                                                                                            </p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>18. Command line crash:</span> Putting the -tYn &lt;years&gt;
switch by itself at the end of a command line would crash, when it should
instead give an error message about the switch having too few parameters.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>19. Command line aspect restrictions:</span> The -RA
switch would always toggle the status of aspect restrictions, even when specified
as =RA or _RA which should force the aspect restriction on or off.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>20. Quotation mark saving:</span> Saving chart info
files with a double quote character in the name or location fields would
generate a corrupt file that would usually produce an error when loaded back
into the program. Double quote characters will now be converted to single
quotes when saved.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>21. File error glitch:</span> When attempting to load
a file whose “.as” extension was explicitly specified, and that file wasn’t
found, the error message would be “file.as.as not found”.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>22. Graphic ephemeris glitch:</span> Displaying the
Part of Fortune in the graphic ephemeris (-E -X switches) would sometimes have
the line for the Part of Fortune cross the entire window instead of wrapping, when
passing over the 0Aries point on the edges of the chart.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>23. Transit Influence selection:</span> In the Windows
version, selecting the Transit to Transit Influence chart in the Transits
dialog wouldn’t automatically switch to text mode. If the program was in
graphics mode, this could make selecting the transit influence chart seemingly
do nothing (because you’d have to manually switch to text mode to see it).</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>24. Command line window sizing:</span> Passing 0 to
the -Xw switch is supposed to use the compile time default size for the window.
On the Windows version this would instead use a default size chosen by Windows.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>25. Rulership update omission:</span> Updating the
sign that a planet rules and co-rules with the -YJ switch wouldn’t update the
reverse mapping (i.e. given a sign, determine what planet rules it) for the
second co-rulership parameter.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>26. Heliocentric Moon velocity:</span> The relative
velocity of the Moon in heliocentric mode (-h -v0 switches) would be much lower
than it should be. (Velocities relative to average speed should always average about
1.0.)</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>27. Graphic date difference:</span> Attempting to
display the date difference comparison relationship chart in graphics mode
would show chart #2 in the wheel, but have the sidebar show the data for chart
#1, producing a weird state in which changing the chart data would only update
the sidebar and seeming to leave the wheel frozen. The date difference chart
has no graphics version, but that state should still show something
understandable, namely just chart #1.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>28. House system display glitch:</span> Some houses
aren’t defined in certain circumstances (such as Placidus and Koch near the
poles). In such cases Astrolog will switch to Porphyry, which is expected
behavior. However in such a case the actual chart would still be titled as
using the original system, and not Porphyry, which isn’t accurate.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>29. Metafile saving:</span> Saving charts to Windows
metafile format or copying them to the clipboard would sometimes produce
display glitches in the file, if more than one file was created during the
session. The second and subsequent files would sometimes have effects such as
wrong colored text that’s no longer visible.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>30. Command line warning:</span> In the command line
version, manually entering a half hour time zone when prompted such as “10:30w”
would display a warning saying “Assuming unusual zone of 50 minutes after the
hour instead of 30”. That warning is bonus, because the time zone will actually
be a half hour (as will entering something like “10.5w”). You have to explicitly
enter something like “10:50w” with a colon to actually get an unusual time zone
50 minutes after an hour.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>31. Chart position limitation:</span> The -YF switch
which -o0 chart position files use to force an object to be a particular value,
when called on a house cusp object, will now always set the object itself as
well as the corresponding house cusp. The Angles are slightly different:
Setting the Ascendant or MC objects won’t affect any house cusps, and setting
the IC or Descendant objects will also set both the house cusp, as well as set
the opposite house cusp to be 180 degrees opposite. This allows chart position
files to properly cover cases where the Ascendant is different from the 1st
cusp and/or the MC is different from the 10th cusp, and also cases where
non-angular houses aren’t 180 degrees opposite each other. The old behavior had
cusp object indexes 4 through 9 only set the corresponding house cusps (and
also set the opposite cusps to be 180 degrees opposite), and it had the other
cusp object indexes only set the cusp object (and set the opposite cusp object
to be 180 degrees opposite). In other words, the old behavior didn’t properly
handle house systems like APC in which opposite cusps aren’t 180 degrees
opposite each other.</p>

<p class=A><span class=Y>32. Compilation errors:</span> The Astrolog 6.40
sources wouldn’t compile if certain compile time options were disabled.
Specifically compiling with GRAPH, PS, or WIRE turned off would result in a few
errors.</p>
